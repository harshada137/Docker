Full set of system libraries and dependencies

Examples: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V

‚úÖ Pros:
Supports multiple OS types (Windows, Linux, etc.)

Strong isolation between VMs

Useful for legacy apps

‚ùå Cons:
Heavyweight (uses more RAM, CPU, storage)

Slower boot time

Duplicated OS across VMs increases size
