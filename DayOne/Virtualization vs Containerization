üß± Virtualization
Definition: Virtualization uses a hypervisor to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine.

Each VM has:
Its own OS (can be different OSs)
Its own kernel
Full set of system libraries and dependencies
Examples: VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V

‚úÖ Pros:
Supports multiple OS types (Windows, Linux, etc.)
Strong isolation between VMs
Useful for legacy apps

‚ùå Cons:
Heavyweight (uses more RAM, CPU, storage)
Slower boot time
Duplicated OS across VMs increases size

üì¶ Containerization
Definition: Containerization uses a container engine like Docker to run isolated applications using the same OS kernel.
Each container shares:
Host OS kernel
But runs its own app with separate libraries and dependencies
Examples: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes (for orchestration)

‚úÖ Pros:
Lightweight (no OS duplication)
Faster startup time
Easier to scale and move across environments (portability)
Ideal for microservices

‚ùå Cons:
Shares host OS, so less isolation than VMs
May not be ideal for apps needing different OS
