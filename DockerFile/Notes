A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to create a Docker image. This image can then be used to run containers. It automates the process of setting up an environment with all the necessary dependencies, configurations, and files.

ðŸ”¹ What Is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a script composed of various commands and arguments listed successively to automatically perform actions on a base image to create a new Docker image.

Think of it like a recipe that Docker reads to build your custom image.

ðŸ”¹ Why Is Dockerfile Important?
Automation: No need to manually configure environments.

Consistency: Same image runs across all environments (dev, test, prod).

Portability: Docker images can run on any system that has Docker installed.

Version Control: Dockerfiles can be stored in Git to track changes.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Structure of a Dockerfile

    # Step 1: Choose a base image
    FROM node:18

    # Step 2: Set working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Step 3: Copy application files
    COPY . .

    # Step 4: Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Step 5: Expose a port (optional)
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Step 6: Command to run the app
    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
 

 
ðŸ”¹ Common Dockerfile Instructions

| Instruction  | Purpose                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FROM`       | Specifies the base image (e.g., `ubuntu`, `node`, `python`) |
| `WORKDIR`    | Sets the working directory inside the container             |
| `COPY`       | Copies files from local system to the container             |
| `RUN`        | Executes a command (e.g., installing packages)              |
| `CMD`        | Default command to run when container starts                |
| `EXPOSE`     | Informs Docker which port the container listens on          |
| `ENV`        | Sets environment variables                                  |
| `ADD`        | Like COPY, but can also extract archives and download URLs  |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Configures a container to run as an executable              |
